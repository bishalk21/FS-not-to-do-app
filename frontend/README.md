This is my Not TÃ¸Do List App.

This is a simple app that I made to learn React and Redux. It is a simple app that allows you to add and remove tasks from a list. It also allows you to mark tasks as completed.

## Installation

To install the app, you need to have Node.js installed. Then, you can run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
